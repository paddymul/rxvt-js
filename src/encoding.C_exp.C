 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioural differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add etiher the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.

 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow

 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ enviroment
 * only supports UNIX03 sementics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targetting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the

 * it looks like 10646 will be a 31 bit standard.  This means that if your
 * ints cannot hold 32 bits, you will be in trouble.  The reason an int was
 * chosen over a long is that the is*() and to*() routines take ints (says
 * ANSI C), but they use __darwin_ct_rune_t instead of int.  By changing it
 * here, you lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still
 * work.
 *
 * NOTE: rune_t is not covered by ANSI nor other standards, and should not
 * be instantiated outside of lib/libc/locale.  Use wchar_t.  wchar_t and

     More Info:  See TechNote 2064

     Contains:   Double-underbar-prefixed availability macros, derived from
                 AvailabilityMacros.h

                 This header enables a developer to specify build time
                 constraints on what Mac OS X versions the resulting
                 application will be run.  There are two bounds a developer
                 can specify:
                 
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
                      
                The lower bound controls which calls to OS functions will 
                be weak-importing (allowed to be unresolved at launch time).
                The upper bound controls which OS functionality, if used,
                will result in a compiler error because that functionality is
                not available on on any OS is the specifed range.
                
                For example, suppose an application is compiled with:
                
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED  = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3
                     
                and an OS header contains:
                
                     extern void funcA(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcB(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER_BUT_DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2;
                     extern void funcC(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER_BUT_DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3;
                     extern void funcD(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_1_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcE(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcF(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcG(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4_AND_LATER;
                     
                     typedef long TypeA __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeB __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_1_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeC __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeD __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeE __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4_AND_LATER;

                Any application code which uses these declarations will get the following:
                
                                compile         link          run
