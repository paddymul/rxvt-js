 * COMPILATION ENVIRONMENTS
 *
 * DEFAULT	By default newly complied code will get POSIX APIs plus
 *		Apple API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		Most users will use this compilation environment to avoid
 *		behavioural differences between 32 and 64 bit code.
 *
 * LEGACY	Defining _NONSTD_SOURCE will get pre-POSIX APIs plus Apple
 *		API extensions in scope.
 *
 *		This is generally equivalent to the Tiger release compilation
 *		environment, except that it cannot be applied to 64 bit code;
 *		its use is discouraged.
 *
 *		We expect this environment to be deprecated in the future.
 *
 * STRICT	Defining _POSIX_C_SOURCE or _XOPEN_SOURCE restricts the
 *		available APIs to exactly the set of APIs defined by the
 *		corresponding standard, based on the value defined.
 *
 *		A correct, portable definition for _POSIX_C_SOURCE is 200112L.
 *		A correct, portable definition for _XOPEN_SOURCE is 600L.
 *
 *		Apple API extensions are not visible in this environment,
 *		which can cause Apple specific code to fail to compile,
 *		or behave incorrectly if prototypes are not in scope or
 *		warnings about missing prototypes are not enabled or ignored.
 *
 * In any compilation environment, for correct symbol resolution to occur,
 * function prototypes must be in scope.  It is recommended that all Apple
 * tools users add etiher the "-Wall" or "-Wimplicit-function-declaration"
 * compiler flags to their projects to be warned when a function is being
 * used without a prototype in scope.
 */

/*
 * The __DARWIN_ALIAS macros are used to do symbol renaming; they allow

 * changed, it is used along with a #ifdef check for __DARWIN_UNIX03
 * if the signature has changed.  Because the __LP64__ enviroment
 * only supports UNIX03 sementics it causes __DARWIN_UNIX03 to be
 * defined, but causes __DARWIN_ALIAS to do no symbol mangling.
 *
 * As a special case, when XCode is used to target a specific version of the
 * OS, the manifest constant __ENVIRONMENT_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED__
 * will be defined by the compiler, with the digits representing major version
 * time 100 + minor version times 10 (e.g. 10.5 := 1050).  If we are targetting
 * pre-10.5, and it is the default compilation environment, revert the
 * compilation environment to pre-__DARWIN_UNIX03.

     More Info:  See TechNote 2064

     Contains:   Double-underbar-prefixed availability macros, derived from
                 AvailabilityMacros.h

                 This header enables a developer to specify build time
                 constraints on what Mac OS X versions the resulting
                 application will be run.  There are two bounds a developer
                 can specify:
                 
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
                      
                The lower bound controls which calls to OS functions will 
                be weak-importing (allowed to be unresolved at launch time).
                The upper bound controls which OS functionality, if used,
                will result in a compiler error because that functionality is
                not available on on any OS is the specifed range.
                
                For example, suppose an application is compiled with:
                
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED  = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3
                     
                and an OS header contains:
                
                     extern void funcA(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcB(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER_BUT_DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2;
                     extern void funcC(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER_BUT_DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3;
                     extern void funcD(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_1_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcE(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcF(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3_AND_LATER;
                     extern void funcG(void) __AVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4_AND_LATER;
                     
                     typedef long TypeA __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_0_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeB __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_1_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeC __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeD __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3_AND_LATER;
                     typedef long TypeE __DEPRECATED_IN_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4_AND_LATER;

                Any application code which uses these declarations will get the following:

/*
 * This file defines five types of data structures: singly-linked lists,
 * singly-linked tail queues, lists, tail queues, and circular queues.
 *
 * A singly-linked list is headed by a single forward pointer. The elements
 * are singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at
 * the expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be
 * added to the list after an existing element or at the head of the list.
 * Elements being removed from the head of the list should use the explicit
 * macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency. A singly-linked list may
 * only be traversed in the forward direction.  Singly-linked lists are ideal
 * for applications with large datasets and few or no removals or for
 * implementing a LIFO queue.
 *
 * A singly-linked tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the
 * head of the list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are
 * singly linked for minimum space and pointer manipulation overhead at the
 * expense of O(n) removal for arbitrary elements. New elements can be added
 * to the list after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the
 * end of the list. Elements being removed from the head of the tail queue
 * should use the explicit macro for this purpose for optimum efficiency.
 * A singly-linked tail queue may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 * Singly-linked tail queues are ideal for applications with large datasets
 * and few or no removals or for implementing a FIFO queue.
 *
 * A list is headed by a single forward pointer (or an array of forward
 * pointers for a hash table header). The elements are doubly linked
 * so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before
 * or after an existing element or at the head of the list. A list
 * may only be traversed in the forward direction.
 *
 * A tail queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or
 * after an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of
 * the list. A tail queue may be traversed in either direction.
 *
 * A circle queue is headed by a pair of pointers, one to the head of the
 * list and the other to the tail of the list. The elements are doubly
 * linked so that an arbitrary element can be removed without a need to
 * traverse the list. New elements can be added to the list before or after
 * an existing element, at the head of the list, or at the end of the list.
 * A circle queue may be traversed in either direction, but has a more
 * complex end of list detection.
 * Note that circle queues are deprecated, because, as the removal log
 * in FreeBSD states, "CIRCLEQs are a disgrace to everything Knuth taught
 * us in Volume 1 Chapter 2. [...] Use TAILQ instead, it provides the same
 * functionality." Code using them will continue to compile, but they
 * are no longer documented on the man page.
 *
 * For details on the use of these macros, see the queue(3) manual page.

 * (which always returns true for regular files - regardless of the amount

 * On input, EV_OOBAND specifies that only OOB data should be looked for.
 * The returned data count is the number of bytes beyond the current OOB marker.
 *
 * On output, EV_OOBAND indicates that OOB data is present
 * If it was not specified as an input parameter, then the data count is the
 * number of bytes before the current OOB marker. If at the marker, the
 * data count indicates the number of bytes available after it.  In either

   No need to #undef the __*_{8,64}_LENGTH_MODIFIER__ macros;
   in fact, you can't #undef them, because later uses of any of

   Expansion of a #define like this one:

        #define x IDENT y

   uses the cpp value of IDENT at the location where x is *expanded*,
